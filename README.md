# Boot Device Benchmarking

A python script that attempts to get a benchmark of boot device performance through random and sequential read, write, and mixed read/write using dd and fio
Results are written in the shell and encoded in a .csv file for easy graph creation
This script was made to compare the performance of the c201s emmc and sd card for PrawnOS
